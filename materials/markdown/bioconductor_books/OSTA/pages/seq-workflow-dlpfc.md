# 13  Workflow: Visium DLPFC

## 13.1 Preamble

### 13.1.1 Introduction

This workflow analyzes a 10x Genomics Visium dataset consisting of one sample (Visium capture area) of postmortem human brain tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region, originally described by Maynard et al. ([2021](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Maynard2021-DLPFC)).

The original full dataset contains 12 samples in total, from 3 donors, with 2 pairs of spatially adjacent replicates (serial sections) per donor (4 samples per donor). Each sample spans several cortical layers plus white matter in a tissue section. The examples in this workflow use a single representative sample, labeled 151673, which is often illustrated in various method papers in spatial omics data analysis.

For more details on the dataset, see Maynard et al. ([2021](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Maynard2021-DLPFC)). The full dataset is publicly available through the *[spatialLIBD](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/spatialLIBD)* Bioconductor package ([Pardo et al. 2022](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Pardo2022-spatialLIBD)). The dataset can also be explored interactively through the [spatialLIBD Shiny web app](http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/).

### 13.1.2 Dependencies

Code

```
library(SpatialExperiment)
library(STexampleData)
library(ggspavis)
library(patchwork)
library(scater)
library(scran)
library(pheatmap)
```

## 13.2 Workflow

### 13.2.1 Load data

Load sample 151673 from the DLPFC dataset. This sample is available as a `SpatialExperiment` object from the *[STexampleData](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/STexampleData)* package.

Code

```
spe <- Visium_humanDLPFC()
dim(spe)
```

```
##  [1] 33538  4992
```

### 13.2.2 Plot data

As an initial check, plot the spatial coordinates (spots) in x-y dimensions, to check that the object has loaded correctly. We use plotting functions from the *[ggspavis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/ggspavis)* package.

Code

```
plotCoords(spe)
```

### 13.2.3 Quality control (QC)

We calculate quality control (QC) metrics using the *[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scater)* package ([McCarthy et al. 2017](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-McCarthy2017-scater)), and apply simple global thresholding-based QC methods to identify any low-quality spots, as described in [Section 10.3](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-quality-control.html#sec-seq-quality-control-global). More details, including more advanced QC approaches, are described in [Chapter 10](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-quality-control.html).

Code

```
# subset to keep only spots over tissue
spe <- spe[, spe$in_tissue == 1]
dim(spe)
```

```
##  [1] 33538  3639
```

Code

```
# identify mitochondrial genes
nms <- rowData(spe)$gene_name
is_mito <- grepl("(^MT-)|(^mt-)", nms)
table(is_mito)
```

```
##  is_mito
##  FALSE  TRUE 
##  33525    13
```

Code

```
nms[is_mito]
```

```
##   [1] "MT-ND1"  "MT-ND2"  "MT-CO1"  "MT-CO2"  "MT-ATP8" "MT-ATP6" "MT-CO3" 
##   [8] "MT-ND3"  "MT-ND4L" "MT-ND4"  "MT-ND5"  "MT-ND6"  "MT-CYB"
```

Calculate QC metrics using *[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scater)* ([McCarthy et al. 2017](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-McCarthy2017-scater)).

Code

```
# calculate per-spot QC metrics and store in colData
spe <- addPerCellQC(spe, subsets=list(mito=is_mito))
```

```
##  Warning in addPerCellQC(spe, subsets = list(mito = is_mito)): 'addPerCellQC' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::quickRnaQc.se' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

```
##  Warning in .per_cell_qc_metrics(assay(x, assay.type), subsets = subsets, : 'perCellQCMetrics' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::computeRnaQcMetrics' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

```
##  using unknown matrix fallback for 'dgTMatrix'
```

Code

```
names(colData(spe))
```

```
##   [1] "barcode_id"            "sample_id"             "in_tissue"            
##   [4] "array_row"             "array_col"             "ground_truth"         
##   [7] "reference"             "cell_count"            "sum"                  
##  [10] "detected"              "subsets_mito_sum"      "subsets_mito_detected"
##  [13] "subsets_mito_percent"  "total"
```

Select global filtering thresholds for the QC metrics by examining distributions using histograms.

Code

```
par(mfrow=c(1, 4))
hist(spe$sum, xlab="sum", main="UMIs per spot")
hist(spe$detected, xlab="detected", main="Genes per spot")
hist(spe$subsets_mito_percent, xlab="pct mito", main="Percent mito UMIs")
hist(spe$cell_count, xlab="no. cells", main="No. cells per spot")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/plt-qc-1.png)

Code

```
# select global QC thresholds
spe$qc_lib_size <- spe$sum < 600
spe$qc_detected <- spe$detected < 400
spe$qc_mito <- spe$subsets_mito_percent > 28

# tabulate flagged cells
cd <- colData(spe)
qc <- grep("^qc", names(cd))
sapply(cd[qc], table)
```

```
##        qc_lib_size qc_detected qc_mito
##  FALSE        3631        3632    3622
##  TRUE            8           7      17
```

Plot the spatial distributions of the potentially identified low-quality spots, to ensure that they are not concentrated within biologically meaningful regions (which could suggest that the selected thresholds were too stringent).

Code

```
# plot spatial distributions of discarded spots
p1 <- plotObsQC(spe, 
    plot_type="spot", 
    annotate="qc_lib_size") + 
    ggtitle("Library size (< threshold)")
p2 <- plotObsQC(spe, 
    plot_type="spot", 
    annotate="qc_detected") +
    ggtitle("Detected genes (< threshold)")
p3 <- plotObsQC(spe, 
    plot_type="spot", 
    annotate="qc_mito") + 
    ggtitle("Mito proportion (> threshold)")

wrap_plots(p1, p2, p3, nrow=1, guides="collect") & labs(col="discard")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/plt-ex-1.png)

Select spots to discard by combining the sets of identified low-quality spots according to each metric.

Code

```
# number of identifed spots for each metric
ex <- cbind(spe$qc_lib_size, spe$qc_detected, spe$qc_mito)
apply(ex, 2, sum)
```

```
##  [1]  8  7 17
```

Code

```
# combined set of identified spots
spe$discard <- rowAnys(ex)
table(spe$discard)
```

```
##  
##  FALSE  TRUE 
##   3614    25
```

Plot the spatial distribution of the combined set of identified low-quality spots to discard, to again confirm that they do not correspond to any clearly biologically meaningful regions, which could indicate that we are removing biologically informative spots. Specifically, in this dataset, we want to ensure that the discarded spots do not correspond to a single cortical layer.

Code

```
# check spatial pattern of discarded spots
plotObsQC(spe, plot_type="spot", annotate="discard")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

Filter out the low-quality spots.

Code

```
# filter out low-quality spots
spe <- spe[, !spe$discard]
dim(spe)
```

```
##  [1] 33538  3614
```

### 13.2.4 Normalization

Calculate log-transformed normalized counts (logcounts) using library size normalization, as described in [Section 11.2](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html#sec-seq-intermediate-processing-norm). We use methods from the *[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scater)* ([McCarthy et al. 2017](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-McCarthy2017-scater)) and *[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scran)* ([Lun, McCarthy, and Marioni 2016](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Lun2016-scran)) packages, making the simplified assumption that spots can be treated as equivalent to single cells. For more details and other options, see [Chapter 11](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html).

Code

```
# calculate library size factors
spe <- computeLibraryFactors(spe)
```

```
##  Warning in .library_size_factors(assay(x, assay.type), ...): 'librarySizeFactors' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::centerSizeFactors' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

Code

```
summary(sf <- sizeFactors(spe))
```

```
##     Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.1330  0.6329  0.8978  1.0000  1.2872  3.7820
```

Code

```
hist(sf, breaks=20, main="Histogram of size factors")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

Code

```
# calculate 'logcounts'
spe <- logNormCounts(spe)
```

```
##  Warning in .local(x, ...): 'normalizeCounts' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::normalizeCounts' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

Code

```
assayNames(spe)
```

```
##  [1] "counts"    "logcounts"
```

### 13.2.5 Feature selection (HVGs)

Apply feature selection methods to identify a set of top highly variable genes (HVGs). We use methods from the *[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scran)* ([Lun, McCarthy, and Marioni 2016](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Lun2016-scran)) package, again making the simplified assumption that spots can be treated as equivalent to single cells. We also first remove mitochondrial genes, since these tend to be very highly expressed and are not of main biological interest. For more details, see [Chapter 11](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html).

For details on alternative feature selection methods to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs) instead of HVGs, for example using the *[nnSVG](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/nnSVG)* ([Weber et al. 2023](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Weber2023-nnSVG)) or other packages, see [Section 29.3.1](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/ind-feature-selection-testing.html#sec-ind-feature-selection-testing-svgs).

Code

```
# remove mitochondrial genes
spe <- spe[!is_mito, ]
dim(spe)
```

```
##  [1] 33525  3614
```

Code

```
# fit mean-variance relationship, decomposing 
# variance into technical & biological components
dec <- modelGeneVar(spe)
```

```
##  Warning in fitTrendVar(fm, fv, ...): 'fitTrendVar' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::fitVarianceTrend' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

```
##  Warning in combineBlocks(collected, method = method, equiweight = equiweight, : 'combineBlocks' is deprecated.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

Code

```
# select top HVGs
hvg <- getTopHVGs(dec, prop=0.1)
```

```
##  Warning in getTopHVGs(dec, prop = 0.1): 'getTopHVGs' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::chooseHighlyVariableGenes' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

Code

```
length(hvg)
```

```
##  [1] 1424
```

### 13.2.6 Dimensionality reduction

Next, we perform dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA), applied to the set of top HVGs. We retain the top 50 principal components (PCs) for further downstream analyses. This is done both to reduce noise and to improve computational efficiency. We also run UMAP on the set of top 50 PCs and retain the top 2 UMAP components for visualization purposes.

We use the computationally efficient implementation of PCA from the *[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scater)* package ([McCarthy et al. 2017](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-McCarthy2017-scater)), which uses randomization and therefore requires setting a random seed for reproducibility.

See [Chapter 11](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html) and [Chapter 27](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/ind-dimensionality-reduction.html) for more details.

Code

```
# using 'scater' package
set.seed(123)
spe <- runPCA(spe, subset_row=hvg)
```

```
##  using unknown matrix fallback for 'dgTMatrix'
```

Code

```
spe <- runUMAP(spe, dimred="PCA")
colnames(reducedDim(spe, "UMAP")) <- paste0("UMAP", 1:2)

# embeddings are matrices with
# rows = cells, columns = dims.
sapply(reducedDims(spe), dim)
```

```
##        PCA UMAP
##  [1,] 3614 3614
##  [2,]   50    2
```

### 13.2.7 Clustering

Next, we apply a clustering algorithm to identify cell types or spatial domains. Note that we are using only molecular features (gene expression) as the input for clustering in this example. Alternatively, we could use a spatially-aware clustering algorithm, as demonstrated in the example in [Section 11.5](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html#sec-seq-intermediate-processing-clustering).

Here, we use graph-based clustering using the Walktrap method implemented in *[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scran)*, applied to the top 50 PCs calculated on the set of top HVGs from above.

For more details on clustering, see [Chapter 28](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/ind-clustering.html).

Code

```
# graph-based clustering
set.seed(123)
g <- buildSNNGraph(spe, k=10, use.dimred="PCA")
```

```
##  Warning in .buildSNNGraph(reducedDim(x, use.dimred), d = NA, transposed = TRUE, : 'buildSNNGraph' is deprecated.
##  Use 'bluster::makeSNNGraph' instead.
##  See help("Deprecated")
```

Code

```
g_walk <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)
table(kid <- g_walk$membership)
```

```
##  
##    1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
##  365 765 875 803 198 370 238
```

Code

```
# store cluster labels in column 'label' in colData
colLabels(spe) <- factor(kid)
```

Visualize the cluster labels by plotting in x-y space, alongside the manually annotated reference labels (`ground_truth`) available for this dataset.

Code

```
# plot cluster labels & annotated reference labels in space
plotCoords(spe, annotate="label", pal="libd_layer_colors") +
plotCoords(spe, annotate="ground_truth", pal="libd_layer_colors")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

We can also plot the cluster labels in the top 2 UMAP dimensions.

Code

```
# plot clusters labels in UMAP dimensions
plotDimRed(spe, plot_type="UMAP", annotate="label", pal="libd_layer_colors")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

### 13.2.8 Differential expression

Identify marker genes for each cluster or spatial domain by testing for differentially expressed genes using pairwise t-tests, specifically testing for upregulation for each cluster or spatial domain.

We use the *[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/scran)* package ([Lun, McCarthy, and Marioni 2016](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Lun2016-scran)) to calculate the differential tests. We use a binomial test, which is a more stringent test than the default pairwise t-tests, and tends to select genes that are easier to interpret and validate experimentally.

See [Chapter 11](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-intermediate-processing.html) or [Chapter 28](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/ind-clustering.html) for more details.

Code

```
# using scran package
mgs <- findMarkers(spe, groups=spe$label, test="binom", direction="up")
```

```
##  Warning in .findMarkers(assay(x, i = assay.type), ...): 'findMarkers' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::scoreMarkers.se' instead.

```
##  Warning in combineMarkers(fit$statistics, fit$pairs, pval.type = pval.type, : 'combineMarkers' is deprecated.

Code

```
top <- lapply(mgs, \(df) rownames(df)[df$Top <= 2])
length(top <- unique(unlist(top)))
```

```
##  [1] 49
```

Visualize the marker genes using a heatmap.

Code

```
pbs <- aggregateAcrossCells(spe, 
    ids=spe$label, subset.row=top,
    use.assay.type="logcounts", statistics="mean")
```

```
##  Warning in .local(x, ...): 'aggregateAcrossCells' is deprecated.
##  Use 'scrapper::aggregateAcrossCells.se' instead.

```

```
##  using unknown matrix fallback for 'dgTMatrix'
```

Code

```
# use gene symbols as feature names
mtx <- t(assay(pbs))
colnames(mtx) <- rowData(pbs)$gene_name

# plot using pheatmap package
pheatmap(mat=mtx, scale="column")
```

## 13.3 spatialLIBD

The examples above demonstrated a streamlined analysis workflow for the Visium DLPFC dataset ([Maynard et al. 2021](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Maynard2021-DLPFC)). In this section, we will use the *[spatialLIBD](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/spatialLIBD)* package ([Pardo et al. 2022](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Pardo2022-spatialLIBD)) to continue analyzing this dataset by creating an interactive `Shiny` website to visualize the data.

NoteWhy use spatialLIBD?

The `spatialLIBD` package has a function, `spatialLIBD::run_app(spe)`, which will create an interactive website using a `SpatialExperiment` object (`spe`). The interactive website it creates has several features that were initially designed for the DLPFC dataset ([Maynard et al. 2021](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Maynard2021-DLPFC)) and later made flexible for any dataset ([Pardo et al. 2022](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Pardo2022-spatialLIBD)). These features include panels to visualize Visium spots:

* for one tissue section at a time, either with interactive or static versions
* for multiple tissue sections at a time, either interactively or statically

Both options work with continuous and discrete variables such as the gene expression and clusters, respectively. The interactive version for discrete variables such as clusters is useful if you want to manually annotate Visium spots, as in Maynard et al. ([2021](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#ref-Maynard2021-DLPFC)). `spatialLIBD` allows users to download the annotated spots and resume your spot annotation work later.

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/spatialLIBD_interactive_cluster.png)

Screenshot of the ‘clusters (interactive)’ section of the ‘spot-level data’ panel created with the full spatialLIBD dataset. The website was created with `spatialLIBD::run_app(spatialLIBD::fetch_data('spe'))` version 1.4.0 and then using the lasso selection, we selected a set of spots in the UMAP interactive plot colored by the estimated number of cells per spot (`cell_count`) on the bottom left, which automatically updated the other three plots.

Visualizing genes or clusters across multiple tissue sections can be useful. For example, here we show the expression levels of *PCP4* across two sets of spatially adjacent replicates. *PCP4* is a marker gene for layer 5 in the gray matter of the DLPFC in the human brain. Spatially adjacent replicates are about 10 μm apart from each other and visualizations like the one below help assess the technical variability in the Visium technology.

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/spatialLIBD_gene_grid.png)

Screenshot of the ‘gene grid (static)’ section of the ‘spot-level data’ panel created with the full spatialLIBD dataset. The website was created with `spatialLIBD::run_app(spatialLIBD::fetch_data('spe'))` version 1.4.0, selecting the *PCP4* gene, selecting the *paper* gene color scale, changing the number of rows and columns in the grid 2, selecting two pairs of spatially adjacent replicate samples (151507, 151508, 151673, and 151674), and clicking on the *upgrade grid plot* button. Note that the default *viridis* gene color scale is color-blind friendly.

You can try out a `spatialLIBD`-powered website yourself by opening [it on your browser](http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD).

Check https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD#shiny-website-mirrors in case you need to use a mirror. `shiny`-powered websites work best on browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, among others.

### 13.3.1 Code prerequisites

For this demo, we will re-use the `spe` object (in *[SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/SpatialExperiment)* format) created in the example DLPFC workflow above. If you are starting from here, you can re-build the object by running the code in section [Section 13.2](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#sec-seq-workflow-dlpfc-workflow) above.

We also load some additional dependency packages.

Code

```
library(BiocFileCache)  # for downloading and storing data
library(rtracklayer)  # for importing gene annotation files
```

In addition, we will modify the final step of the workflow above, where we identified marker genes per cluster by differential expression testing. We will modify this step to summarize the results of the differential expression testing in a different way, and store this information in the `spe` object.

Code

```
# identify interesting markers for each cluster
interesting <- sapply(mgs, function(x) x$Top <= 5)
colnames(interesting) <- paste0("gene_interest_", seq_len(length(mgs)))
rowData(spe) <- cbind(rowData(spe), interesting)
```

### 13.3.2 Prepare for spatialLIBD

We also need to modify the `spe` object, similar to steps we need to carry out when [using spatialLIBD with 10x Genomics public datasets](https://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/articles/TenX_data_download.html#modify-spe-for-spatiallibd-1).

#### 13.3.2.1 Basic information

Code

```
# add some information used by spatialLIBD
spe$key <- paste0(spe$sample_id, "_", colnames(spe))
spe$sum_umi <- colSums(counts(spe))
spe$sum_gene <- colSums(counts(spe) > 0)
```

#### 13.3.2.2 Gene annotation

Since the gene information is missing, we will add [gene annotation data from Gencode](https://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/articles/TenX_data_download.html#add-gene-annotation-information-1). Alternatively, ideally you would add this information from the same gene annotation used for originally running Space Ranger.

It can happen that `bfcrpath()` fails to connect with the Gencode database. If this is the case, we disable consecutive code evaluations for the purpose of this book’s stability. Outputs typically reappear with the next build.

Code

```
# download Gencode v32 GTF file and cache it
nms <- paste0(
  "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/",
  "release_32/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf.gz")
bfc <- BiocFileCache()
gtf_cache <- bfcrpath(bfc, nms)
```

Code

```
# show GTF cache location
gtf_cache

```

Now that we have the gene annotation information, we can use it to add a few more pieces to our `spe` object that `spatialLIBD` will use. For example, we want to enable users to search genes by either their gene symbol or their Ensembl ID. We would also like to visualize the amount and percent of the mitochondrial gene expression.

Code

```
# add information used by spatialLIBD
rowData(spe)$gene_search <- with(rowData(spe), 
    paste(gene_name, gene_id, sep="; "))

# compute chrM expression and chrM expression ratio
is_mito <- which(seqnames(spe) == "chrM")
spe$expr_chrM <- colSums(counts(spe)[is_mito, , drop=FALSE])
spe$expr_chrM_ratio <- spe$expr_chrM / spe$sum_umi
```

#### 13.3.2.3 Extra information and filtering

Now that we have the full gene annotation information we need, we can proceed to add some last touches as well as [filter the object](https://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/articles/TenX_data_download.html#filter-the-spe-object-1) to reduce the memory required for visualizing the data.

Code

```
# add a variable for saving the manual annotations
spe$ManualAnnotation <- "NA"

# remove genes with no data
no_expr <- which(rowSums(counts(spe)) == 0)

# number of genes with no counts
length(no_expr)
```

```
##  [1] 11547
```

Code

```
# compute percent of genes with no counts
length(no_expr) / nrow(spe) * 100
```

```
##  [1] 34.71007
```

Code

```
spe <- spe[-no_expr, , drop=FALSE]

# remove spots without counts
summary(spe$sum_umi)
```

```
##     Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##      537    2400    3442    3849    4921   15862
```

Code

```
# if we had spots with no counts, we would remove them
if (any(spe$sum_umi == 0)) {
    spots_no_counts <- which(spe$sum_umi == 0)
    # number of spots with no counts
    print(length(spots_no_counts))
    # percent of spots with no counts
    print(length(spots_no_counts) / ncol(spe) * 100)
    spe <- spe[, -spots_no_counts, drop=FALSE]
}
```

We should now be ready to proceed to making our interactive website. To confirm, we can use the `spatialLIBD::check_spe()` to verify that everything is set up correctly. If not, this function will tell us what we missed.

Code

```
# run check_spe() function
spatialLIBD::check_spe(spe)
```

```
##  class: SpatialExperiment 
##  dim: 21720 3614 
##  metadata(0):
##  assays(2): counts logcounts
##  rownames(21720): ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000238009 ... ENSG00000160307
##    ENSG00000160310
##  rowData names(13): source type ... gene_interest_7 gene_search
##  colnames(3614): AAACAAGTATCTCCCA-1 AAACAATCTACTAGCA-1 ...
##    TTGTTTGTATTACACG-1 TTGTTTGTGTAAATTC-1
##  colData names(26): barcode_id sample_id ... expr_chrM_ratio
##    ManualAnnotation
##  reducedDimNames(2): PCA UMAP
##  mainExpName: NULL
##  altExpNames(0):
##  spatialCoords names(2) : pxl_col_in_fullres pxl_row_in_fullres
##  imgData names(4): sample_id image_id data scaleFactor
```

### 13.3.3 Explore the data

In order to visualize the data, we can then use `spatialLIBD::vis_gene()`. This is also a useful final check before we try launching our interactive website.

Code

```
# sum of UMI
spatialLIBD::vis_gene(spe, sampleid="sample_151673", geneid="sum_umi")
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/spatialLIBD_vis_gene-1.png)

Code

```
# PCP4 (layer 5 marker gene)
gid <- rowData(spe)$gene_search[which(rowData(spe)$gene_name == "PCP4")]
spatialLIBD::vis_gene(spe, sampleid="sample_151673", geneid=gid)
```

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/spatialLIBD_vis_gene-2.png)

Now, let’s proceed to [visualize the data interactively](https://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/articles/TenX_data_download.html#run-the-interactive-website-1) with a `spatialLIBD`-powered website. We have a number of variables to choose from. We will specify which are the continuous and discrete variables in our `spatialLIBD::run_app()` call.

Code

```
# run our shiny app
if (interactive()) {
    spatialLIBD::run_app(
        spe,
        sce_layer=NULL,
        modeling_results=NULL,
        sig_genes=NULL,
        title="OSTA spatialLIBD workflow example",
        spe_discrete_vars=c("ground_truth", "label", "ManualAnnotation"),
        spe_continuous_vars=c(
            "cell_count",
            "sum_umi",
            "sum_gene",
            "expr_chrM",
            "expr_chrM_ratio",
            "sum",
            "detected",
            "subsets_mito_sum",
            "subsets_mito_detected",
            "subsets_mito_percent",
            "total",
            "sizeFactor"
        ),
        default_cluster="label"
    )
}
```

NoteSharing your website

Now that you have created a `spatialLIBD`-powered website, you might be interested in sharing it. To do so, it will be useful to save a small `spe` object using `saveRDS()`, containing the data to share. The smaller the object, the better in terms of performance. For example, you may want to remove lowly expressed genes to save space. You can check the object size in R with `object.size()`.

Code

```
# object size
format(object.size(spe), units="MB")
```

```
##  [1] "308.1 Mb"
```

If your data is small enough, you might want to share your website by hosting on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) by Posit (the company that develops RStudio), which you can try for free. Once you have created your account, you need to create an `app.R` file like the one we have [on the `spatialLIBD_demo` directory](https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-resources/tree/main/spatialLIBD_demo).

```
##  library("spatialLIBD")
##   library("markdown") # for shinyapps.io
##   
##   ## spatialLIBD uses golem
##   options("golem.app.prod" = TRUE)
##   
##   ## You need this to enable shinyapps to install Bioconductor packages
##   options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
##   
##   ## Load the data
##   spe <- readRDS("spe_workflow_Visium_spatialLIBD.rds")
##   
##   ## Deploy the website
##   spatialLIBD::run_app(
##       spe,
##       sce_layer = NULL,
##       modeling_results = NULL,
##       sig_genes = NULL,
##       title = "OSTA spatialLIBD workflow example",
##       spe_discrete_vars = c("ground_truth", "label", "ManualAnnotation"),
##       spe_continuous_vars = c(
##           "cell_count",
##           "sum_umi",
##           "sum_gene",
##           "expr_chrM",
##           "expr_chrM_ratio",
##           "sum",
##           "detected",
##           "subsets_mito_sum",
##           "subsets_mito_detected",
##           "subsets_mito_percent",
##           "total",
##           "sizeFactor"
##       ),
##       default_cluster = "label",
##       docs_path = "www"
##   )
```

You can then open R in a new session in the same directory where you saved the `app.R` file, run the code and click on the “publish” blue button at the top right of your RStudio window. You will then need to upload the `app.R` file, your `.rds` file containing the `spe` object, and the files under the `www` directory which enable you to customize your `spatialLIBD` website.

![](../../../../raw/bioconductor_books/assets/OSTA/seq-workflow-dlpfc/spatialLIBD_publish.png)

Screenshot of the RStudio window for publishing your spatialLIBD-powered website to shinyapps.io

The RStudio prompts will guide you along the process for authenticating to your `shinyapps.io` account, which will involve copy-pasting some code that starts with `rsconnect::setAccountInfo()`. Alternatively, you can create a `deploy.R` script and write the code for uploading your files to `shinyapps.io` as shown below.

```
##  library('rsconnect')
##   
##   ## Or you can go to your shinyapps.io account and copy this
##   ## Here we do this to keep our information hidden.
##   # load(".deploy_info.Rdata")
##   # rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
##   #     name = deploy_info$name,
##   #     token = deploy_info$token,
##   #     secret = deploy_info$secret
##   # )
##   
##   ## You need this to enable shinyapps to install Bioconductor packages
##   options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
##   
##   ## Deploy the app, that is, upload it to shinyapps.io
##   rsconnect::deployApp(
##       appFiles = c(
##           "app.R",
##           "spe_workflow_Visium_spatialLIBD.rds",
##           dir("www", full.names = TRUE)
##       ),
##       appName = 'OSTA_spatialLIBD_demo',
##       account = 'libd',
##       server = 'shinyapps.io'
##   )
```

Note that we have copied the default [`www` directory files from the `spatialLIBD` repository](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/tree/master/inst/app/www) and [adapted them](https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-resources/tree/main/spatialLIBD_demo/www). We then use these files with `spatialLIBD::run_app(docs_path)` in our `app.R` script. These files help us control portions of our `spatialLIBD`-powered website and customize it.

If you follow this workflow, you will end up with a website [just like this one](https://libd.shinyapps.io/OSTA_spatialLIBD_demo/). In our case, we further configured our website through the `shinyapps.io` dashboard. We selected the following options:

* *General* `Instance Size`: 3X-Large (8GB)
* *Advanced* `Max Worker Processes`: 1
* *Advanced* `Max Connections`: 15

The `Max Worker Processes` determines how many R sessions are open per instance. Then `Max Connections` specifies the number of connections to each R session. The `Instance Size` determines the memory available. In this case, 8000 / 300 is approximately 27, but we decided to be conservative and set the total number of users per instance to 15. This is why it can be important to reduce the size of your `spe` object before sharing the website. Alternatively, you can rent an AWS Instance and deploy your app there, which is how http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD is hosted along with these [error configuration files](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/tree/master/dev/shiny-server-files).

### 13.3.4 Wrapping up

Thank you for reading this far! In this section we showed you:

* why you might be interested in using `spatialLIBD`,
* we re-used the `spe` object from the DLPFC workflow ([Section 13.2](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSTA/pages/seq-workflow-dlpfc.html#sec-seq-workflow-dlpfc-workflow)),
* we adapted the `spe` object to make it compatible with `spatialLIBD`,
* we created an interactive website on our laptops,
* we shared the website with others using `shinyapps.io`.
